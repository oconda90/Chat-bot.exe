# Chat-bot.exe
In this project for my cs 1.0 class we were  told to make a chat bot.
My chat bot will prompt the user questions about their interest.
The user will be able to put in input.

There will be a list in my code that holds elements.
If the user types in one of those elements my chat bot will return a sentence.
If the user doesnt meet set conditons it will promt a diffrenet sentence.
I will use the knowlegde i learned from my insturctor and coach.
